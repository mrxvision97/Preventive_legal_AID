    "answer": "Generally, no. Most jurisdictions require landlords to provide reasonable notice (typically 24-48 hours) before entering your rental unit, except in emergencies. Check your lease agreement and local tenant laws for specific requirements. Landlords usually need a valid reason such as repairs, inspections, or showing the property to prospective tenants.",

If you're doing regular employee work, you may be entitled to minimum wage. The 'primary beneficiary test' is often used to determine legality.
